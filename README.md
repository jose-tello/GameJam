# Vertical SliceR

Vertical SliceR is a 4-person game developed during Itch.io's 131st mini game jam (of 2 days). It is a game centered around the theme of
"Solar", and the limitation of "failure is progress". The gameplay consists of reaching the bottom of a tower of blocks by
stepping on them, before the player health is fully depleted. The theme has been integrated through solar beams that hurt the
player as the main obstacle, and the limitation is mirrored such that in order to complete the tower in time, the player has to
actually get hit, which puts them in a state that destroys blocks faster. To remedy that, during such state, the player heals for
every block they break.
